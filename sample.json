He is available to answer emails in minutes almost 24/7 and is very helpful. answers questions very in depth and is such a caring person overall. i'd give him 6/5 if I could.",

If it isn't on the test, it isn't on the slide. very nice\nAlso Between Youtube audiobooks and sparknotes I didn't spend a single extra penny for this class. If you have any emails, the professor will get back to you literally within minutes. Not to mention allowing assignment extensions if you contact him. \n",
